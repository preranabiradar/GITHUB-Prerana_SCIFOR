1. What are semantic elements ?
 answer:-
        Semantic tags can be divided into two types.
        1.Semantic tag :-
                        It describes its meaning,its purpose,and it describes the type of content.
              for example:-

              <h1></h1>
              h1 tags describes heading of the text.

              <table></table>
              Table tag descibes the table and inside of the content within the table.

              <header></header>
              Header is Present at the top of the webpage.Header tag describes the header of the webpage.
             
              <footer></footer>
              Footer is present at the end of the webpage.Footer tag describes the footer of the webpage.

              <section></section>
               Section tag defines the section of documents such as chapters, headers,footers, or any other sections. The section tag divides the content into sections and subsections.

              <h2>....</h2>,
              <h3>....</h3>,
              <h4>....</h4>,
              <h5>....</h5>,
              <h6>....</h6>,These all are heading tags.

              <figure>
              <main>
              <main>
              <nav>
              <strong>
              These all tags defines its content.



        2.Non-semantic Tag :-
                            Non-Semantic tags do not have a specific meaning.It is used to create general meaning for content without containing any additional information.

                            For example :-

                                 <span>text</span>
                                 This tag adds anywhere in the tag and anywhere in the webpage.
                                 We also add span tag in the paragraph tag.

                                 <div></div>
                                 It also a non semantic tag.We cannot decide the meaning of the text.
